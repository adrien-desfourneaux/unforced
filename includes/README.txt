Dear All,

Please place the php Toolkit 13.0 in the soapclient folder.  This can be found here: http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/PHP_Toolkit It is important that you use the 13.0 version as there are some problems with previous versions.

You need to then extract your partner WSDL and place it in the soapclient folder, to get your partner WSDL follow these instructions:
http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/sforce70/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=sforceAPI_WWHelp&file=sforce_API_partner_intro.html

That should be the salesforce side set up.  Next thing to do is get the MySQL side sorted.

Download the adodb package (i used the adodb-php5-only version)
http://adodb.sourceforge.net/#download

copy the files into the adodb folder.

Right, that's it for here, next you need to sort out your usernames and passwords.

Any questions please drop me a mail at pkemp@teachfirst.org.uk.

Pete
